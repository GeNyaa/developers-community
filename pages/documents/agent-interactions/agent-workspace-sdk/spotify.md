### Disclaimer

The repository below contains sample code to provide guidance with using LiveEngage APIs to create custom experiences. This code is provided as-is and can be used by the brand for futher branding and optimization at their discretion. It is not subject to LivePerson SLAs or feature requests.

### Overview

The file transfer widget is a Node.js web app that uploads files to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and generates access links that can be provided to share a file. The widget uses LiveEngage SDKs (Agent Workspace Widget SDK and Engagement Window Widget SDK) to display file transfer forms, links, and alerts between Agent and Client Sessions. The agent and consumer connection is maintained by an authenticated Pusher.js service. The repo also provides one method of localization that can be used to translate phrases between multiple languages. The service makes use of a SPA architecture on the client side.
