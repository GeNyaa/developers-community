Here are a few sample bot integrations, which demonstrates some of the use cases that can be achieved with the SDK:

### Greeting Bot Example

This example demonstrates running a System Message type bot, which subscribes to all of the incoming conversation, and sends the first welcome message.

### Agent Bot Example

This example demonstrates running ​a ​bot using the major API calls.

Use the agent bot example when you are looking to review and develop with the various available API calls, such as:

* getClock

* agentRequestConversation

* subscribeExConversations

* unsubscribeExConversations

* updateConversationField

* publishEvent

* queryMessages

* updateRingState

* subscribeRoutingTasks

* updateRoutingTaskSubscription

* getUserProfile

* setAgentState

* subscribeAgentsState

### Bots Cluster Example

This example demonstrates running a bot on a ​horizontal scalable cluster. It can be used for a few use cases:

* Bot Resiliency - If one node crashes, one ​of the other ​clusters ​will reconnect the bot.

* Multiple Bots - The bots will be spread across the cluster’s nodes. If one node fails the other will share its bots. If a new node is added to the cluster it will take some of the bots from other nodes.
