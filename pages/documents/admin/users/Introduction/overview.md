### Introduction

Users within LiveEngage can be agents, agent managers, administrators or campaign managers.  For brands with large number of agents, the user list may need to be updated on a regular basis.  The user entity includes name, picture URL, password, skill and other important user information.

### Getting Started

A few things you'll need to get started with this API:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html){:target="_blank"} to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

	* Read only: accountConfigReadOnly

	* Read/Write: accountConfigReadWrite

2. This API requires authorization using _either_ a login or an API key methodology.

	* **Log a user into LiveEngage** using the [Login Service API](login-getting-started.html){:target="_blank"}. Provide a username and password, and receive an authorization token (bearer). Use this token as your authorization header in all API requests.

	* [Follow these instructions](guides-gettingstarted.html){:target="_blank"}, to create and use an API key.
