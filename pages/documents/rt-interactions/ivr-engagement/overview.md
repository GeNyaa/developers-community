### Introduction

In addition to cost-effectiveness over voice, live messaging and chat interactions have also been proven to drive higher CSAT. In a study conducted by Amdocs, 76% of consumers say they prefer to communicate with brands via mobile messaging. However, 92% of interactions with brands are still conducted over the phone.

The LivePerson IVR Deflection Solution provides brands with the opportunity to facilitate consumers who have already dialed their service number with the option to move their interaction to mobile messaging.

Providing consumers with a digital choice lowers the volume of calls connected with agents, decreases the length of call queues, and provides an overall improved customer experience.

**Benefits of the IVR Deflection Solution**

Moving calls to mobile messaging provides increased opportunities for app downloads and usage as well as future self-service. The IVR Deflection Solution enhances customer experience by providing an intelligent concierge service tailored to the customer or transaction type.

Top use cases of deflecting calls to mobile messaging are for inquiries that are digital in nature. The following scenarios support the notions that IVR and voice are less ideal channels for many types of customer service and that, optimally, consumers contacting brands via phone should be migrated to mobile messaging.

* Technical inquiries regarding online accounts or digital assets, for example, password resets or account activations.

* Inquiries regarding services provided online or via mobile apps, for example, a current account balance or a bill dispute.

* Requests regarding services provided online or via mobile apps, for example, ordering checks or signing up for digital services such as automatic bill payment or alerts.
