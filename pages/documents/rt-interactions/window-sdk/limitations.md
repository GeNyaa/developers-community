- The SDK will only communicate with the Engagement Window if the account has
configured an iframe widget that refers to a web page developed using the SDK.
- The SDK only supports browsers which implement the postMessage API, and have
native JSON implementation, for example, IE8+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IOS,
Opera Mini, and Android.
- IE9, Firefox and Opera Mini do not support MessageChannel, and therefore the fallback
uses basic postMessage. This makes the communication open to any handler
registered for messages with the same origin.
- When the browser does not support passing an object using postMessage (IE8+, Opera
Mini), and no special serialize/deserialize methods are supplied, all data is serialized
using JSON.stringify/JSON.parse. This means that object data is limited to any JSON
which supports types such as strings, numbers, null, arrays, and objects, and does not
allow circular references. Trying to serialize other types will result in conversion to null
(like Infinity or NaN) or to a string (Dates), that must be manually deserialized on the
other side.
- If the visitor refreshes the iframe widget, the page is reloaded from scratch. Any
databindings that existed before refreshing are removed.
- The application you are developing must be able to open within an iframe. Some
applications, known as ‘Frame Busters’, prevent themselves from opening within an
iframe.
- The application must be hosted over SSL, meaning that the URL must start with https.
- Custom widgets should not include LiveEngage chat buttons or any other LiveEngage
objects such as the lpTag.
- Currently, the SDK works on LiveChat only.
