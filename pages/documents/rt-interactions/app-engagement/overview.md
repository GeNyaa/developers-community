### Introduction

When implementing an API based chat windows in non-monitored flow (When the LiveEngage LpTag is not part of the flow), getting the Engagement is within the responsibility of the Chat API Based window Service.

In order to present a "Click to Chat" button with an updated state of availability, you must access the LP Monitoring system to create a visitor session and get an engagement. This call can be made by the getEngagement() function by the App Engagement API. _Note_: whenever you call this method, a new visitor will be created in the Visitor List. To avoid creating unnecessary load, it is advisable to use this method sparingly.

The App Engagement API exposes an eligibility and availability check for engagements for any specific consumer from an external application. This API enables you to start a session, and update the session with SDEs.

### Getting Started

A few things you'll need to get started with this API:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html){:target="_blank"} to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

	* msdkgw

### Use Cases
