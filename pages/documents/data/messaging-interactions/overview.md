### Introduction

The LiveEngage Messaging Interactions API retrieves the most up to date information available about contact center messaging interactions. This API makes it possible to search, filter and analyze data and transcripts of open and closed conversations.

The API returns the conversationâ€™s transcripts and all of its related metadata such as start time, end time, MCS, CSAT, summary, participated agents, the reason the conversation was closed etc.

This API supports the HTTP POST functionality (data retrieval), and all data is returned in JSON format.

### Getting Started

A few things you'll need to get started with this API:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html){:target="_blank"} to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

	* msgHist

2. This API requires authorization using API key.

	* [Follow these instructions](guides-gettingstarted.html){:target="_blank"}, to create and use an API key. Temporarily, please utilize the same key as the Engagement History API.
