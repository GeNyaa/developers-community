Retrieves the distribution of visitors’ wait time in the queue, before an agent replies to their chat. The wait time in the histogram is accurate (no more than +/- 5 seconds). Histogram bucket sizes are specified in multiples of 5 seconds.

*Note: SLA is calculated using bucket-based aggregation techniques, in which events are collected into 5 minute buckets. For this reason, events may be included that took place outside of the requested time frame.*

*Example: If the current time is 13:29 and the required time frame is 7 minutes, the API will use 2 buckets: 13:25 and 13:30. The time of the collected data is actually not 13:22-13:29, but 13:20-13:29.*

### Request

| Method | URL |
| :-------- | :----- |
| GET | `https://<domain>/operations/api/account/{accountID}/sla?timeframe=<timeframe in minutes>&skillIds=<skillIDs>&groupIds=<groupIds>&histogram=<histogram bucket list>&v=<version>`

URL Parameters

| Name | Description | Type / Value |  Required |
| :------ | :------- | :----------- | :--- |
| timeframe | The time range (in minutes) in which the data can be filtered. Where end time = current time, and start time = end time - timeframe. The maximum timeframe value is 1440 minutes (24 hours). | numeric | required |
| v | Version of API, for example, v=1. | numeric | required |
| skillIds | When provided, SLA will be calculated only for interactions involving agents of the specified skills. You can provide one or more skill IDs. <br> Example: skillIds=4,15,3. <br> To retrieve all skills active for the time period, use skillIds=all. If no skillIds is provided, ‘all’ is assumed. | numeric, comma separated, or ‘all’ | optional |
| groupIds | When provided, SLA will be calculated only for interactions involving agents of the specified groups. You can provide one or more agent group IDs. <br> Example: groupIds=4,15,3. <br> To retrieve all agent groups active for the time period, use groupIds=all. If no groupIds is provided, ‘all’ is assumed. | numeric, comma separated, or ‘all’ | optional |
| histogram | Histogram bucket ranges (in seconds). Values in the list must be multiples of 5 seconds. Each value is taken as the lower limit of a bucket. The value ‘0’ is always assumed to be part of the histogram. The highest value in the histogram will bucket all waiting times that are higher. <br> Example: histogram=0,50,100,200,400,1000 <br> If no histogram is provided, the default histogram is assumed: 0,15,30,45,60,90,120 | numeric, comma separated | optional |

### Response

**Elements in the Response**

| Name | Description | Type / Value |
| :------ | :------------ | :-------------- |
| slaDataRange | Root element of the response. Contains a list of sub elements with numeric names, one for each histogram bucket. The names of the sub elements represent the start of the bucket (in seconds). | element |
| accumulated | The percentage of chats that fall in this bucket or in earlier buckets (buckets for shorter queue wait periods). | long |
| percentageFromTotal | The percentage of chats that fall in this bucket. | long |
| chats | The number of chats with wait time that falls in this bucket. | long |
