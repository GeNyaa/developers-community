**Notes**:

- *This API does not support sending HTML, therefore HTML will be presented as text to the agent and will not be translated into its representation.*
- *The "ended" event ends the chat (and adds an "ended" event to the chat content), but it does NOT delete the chat session resource.*
- *Only one event can be added per POST event request.*
