If you plan to offer a new language not yet available in the SDK, please to speak to your LivePerson account manager. These settings should only be used to customize the wording according to you app's needs. To find the String resources available for public customization, please check the `res` folder in the SDK project.

**NOTE:** More options will become available once the SDK is out of BETA
