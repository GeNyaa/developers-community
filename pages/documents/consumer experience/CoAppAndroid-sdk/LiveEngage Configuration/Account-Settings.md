### Account features

By default, voice & video is __not enabled__ in your LiveEngage account. Please contact your LivePerson account manager to have this feature enabled for you.

### User Profiles

Your agents on LiveEngage require a specific set of skills in order to use the **voice**, **video** or **In-app CoBrowse** capabilities of your account.

By default, these settings are enabled for your "agent" role. If you wish to disable or customize them for specific **Agent Groups**, follow these steps:

  1. Goto the **Users** tab
  2. Select **Profiles**
  3. Select the profile you wish to edit (usually: __Agent__)

Enable the permissions you wish to _grant_ to your group:

  *  _Initiate voice conversation_
  *  _Initiate live video_
  *  _Initiate CoBrowse view-only session, with scroll-control_ (1)
  *  _Initiate CoBrowse view-only session_
  *  _Initiate CoBrowse shared control session_

All of these settings should be self-explanatory.

_(1) Scroll-only is currently supported in Web-based CoBrowse only. For in-app CoBrowse this setting is identical to the normal view-only mode._


### Invitation Options
The settings you chose in **User Profiles** will be reflected in all of your account's **Messaging conversations** (not Chat). Depending on the features you enabled, you will see something similar to below:
