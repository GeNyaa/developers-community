Bundled with our SDK is a sample application written in `Swift`. It showcases a minimal setup of the __Voice & Video SDK__ bundled together with our __Messaging SDK__.

In order to minimize setup effort, the sample app uses [_CocoaPods_](https://cocoapods.org/about).

1. `cd` to `/Sample Apps/Swift/`
2. Type `pod repo update && pod install`
3. Open **sampleapp-swift.xcworkspace** in _XCode_
4. Replace `accountNumber` in _AppDelegate.swift_ with your LP Account Id
5. Run `sample-app-swift`target


**Hint:** Unless you implement the [VoIP setup](consumer-experience-voice-video-ios-voip-configuration.html), your sample app won't be able to receive calls outside of the messaging window.
