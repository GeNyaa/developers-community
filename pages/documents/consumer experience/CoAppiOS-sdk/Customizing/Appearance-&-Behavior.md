Below you'll learn how to customize various SDK settings to fit your app's needs. You can customise different aspects of the SDK:

   * [General Behavior](consumer-experience-voice-video-ios-appearance-behavior.html#behavior)
   * [Appearance](consumer-experience-voice-video-ios-appearance-behavior.html#appearance)
   * [Sounds](consumer-experience-voice-video-ios-appearance-behavior.html#sounds)

***

### Step 1: Setup

In your XCode project create a new `plist` file named:

  * `LPCoAppSDK.plist` and include it into your app target resources

### Step 2: Add custom settings

Open your `LPCoAppSDK.plist` in XCode and add the settings you wish to customize.

### Behavior
<style>
td:first-child {
  width: 200px!important;
}
</style>

| Key        | Type | Default Value | About  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----|
|  **acceptCallOnNotificationTap** | BOOL  | YES  | Determines if a tap on a Push-call notification is considered **Accepting** the call. If set to `NO`, the user is presented the call screen and must accept explicitly. |
| **ringRepeatTimes** | Number | 3 | The number of times a push-call is presented to the user when the app is in background. _Hint_: On average a notification (with ring) is presented _7 seconds_, followed by a _3 second_ pause. So the total ring duration of **3** repeats amounts to approx. 3 * 10 = 30 seconds. iOS will limit to **4x repeats at max** |
| **speakerOnVideo** | BOOL | YES | Determines if the phone's speaker should be automatically enabled when a video call is started. This is recommended, as the volume in non-speaker mode is too low to be heard from a viewing distance. |
| **useProximitySensor** | BOOL | YES | Determines if the device's screen should be switched off and camera streaming should be paused, while the device is close to a user's ear (e.g. in a voice-call)  |

### Appearance

| Key        | Type | Default Value | About  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----|
|  **cobrowseFrameColor** | String  | #004dc9   | The color of the frame surrounding the app's screen during a CoBrowse session. Use a HEX color value as String, including a leading hash (#) |
| **cobrowseTitleColor** | String | #ffffff | The color of the title on the top bar during a CoBrowse session. Make sure the color is sufficiently visible against the `cobrowseFrameColor` background |

### Sounds

| Key        | Type | Default Value | About  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----|
|  **ringSound** | String  | ring.caf   | The ring sound file in you `Main.bundle` played when an incoming call is presented to the user. __Note__: This does not affect the ring of push-calls. Push-calls always use a file named `ring.caf` |
| **escalationSound** | String | escalation.caf | The sound in your `Main.bundle` played, when a call escalation (permissions request) is presented to the user. This sound is played once and should be no more than `3 seconds` long |

**Hint:** `caf` files are optimized audio files for iOS. You can convert any `aiff` file using the command below:

`afconvert -v -f 'caff' -d aac -s 1 -b 192000 MySource.aif MyOutput.caf`
