During the course of the conversation, consumers can take several actions such as Mark as urgent to receive a faster service, or Resolve conversation to let your agents know they have received their answers.

LivePerson API:

```javascript
public static void checkActiveConversation(final ICallback<Boolean, Exception> callback)
public static void checkConversationIsMarkedAsUrgent(final ICallback<Boolean, Exception> callback) 
public static void checkAgentID(final ICallback<AgentData, Exception> callback)
public static void markConversationAsUrgent()
public static void markConversationAsNormal()
public static void resolveConversation()
public static boolean clearHistory()
```
