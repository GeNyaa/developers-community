### Overview

This section describes the photo sharing behavior and configurations in the Messaging SDK.
You can find all the related configurations in the resources ID table, under Photo Sharing. 

**Notes:**

- *This feature is available only for the In-App Messaging SDK.*
- *This feature enables photo sharing only (not video/files).*
- *Photo-sharing is one-way only: Photos can be sent from consumer to agent, but not vice versa.*
- *Device storage includes up to 20 images - this is configurable.*
- *Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .gif (non-animated).*
- *Photo size reduction: Thumbnail - 30 KB, Preview -3 MB.*
- *The SDK version contains a beta version of the Photo sharing feature. For now the SDK doesnâ€™t support continuous uploading photos outside the conversation screen. Full-blown solution is under construction.*

### Enable Photo Sharing

To enable/disable photo sharing you can change the boolean value ```<bool name="enable_photo_sharing">```. By default this value is set to false. 

###  Upload Photo

To upload a photo, press on the "attach" button next to the "enter message" edit text.

A menu will open with 2 options: Gallery and Camera. If the user had set a default app for any of those action- it will be open by default. Otherwise Android OS will open a popup menu with all the available apps for the relevant category (gallery or camera).
