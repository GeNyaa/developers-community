When using SSO in an authenticated connection, an auth-code is passed to the SDK (see [showConversation](consumer-experience-ios-sdk-showconversation.html){:target="_blank"} API). The session in this case might have an expiration date (see [LPMessagingSDKTokenExpired](consumer-experience-ios-sdk-callbacks.html){:target="_blank"}). To reconnect with a new token, use the following ‘reconnect’ API and pass the new token. 

`func reconnect(_ conversationQuery: ConversationParamProtocol, authenticationCode: String)`

| Parameter | Description | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| conversationQuery | Represents a ‘filter’ for the conversation screen, determining which of the conversations will be displayed in the following screens. | Default: sorts the conversations by account number. <br> See helpers methods above for how to generate a conversation query. |
| authenticationCode | The SDK can enable code-flow SSO. | If your account uses SSO, pass the auth-code here. Otherwise, skip this parameter. |
