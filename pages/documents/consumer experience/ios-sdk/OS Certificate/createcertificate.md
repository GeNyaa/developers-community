In order for the push notification to work, you will need two .pem files:

1. A certificate file stored using a pem format.
2. A Key file stored using a pem format without a password.

### Creating a Certificate Signing Request file

With this file, we will create both a .p12 file and a .crt file.

To manually generate a Certificate, you need a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file from your Mac. To create a CSR file, follow the instructions below to create one using Keychain Access.

**Step 1**

- In the Applications folder on your Mac, open the Utilities folder, and launch Keychain Access.
- Within the Keychain Access dropdown menu, select **Keychain Access** > **Certificate Assistant** > **Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority**.

**Step 2**

- In the Certificate Information window, enter the following information:
	- In the User Email Address field, enter your email address.
	- In the Common Name field, create a name for your private key, for example,John Doe Dev Key.
	- The CA Email Address field should be left empty.
	- In the Request is group, select the Saved to disk option.

**Step 3**

In Keychain Access, click **Continue** to complete the CSR generating process.

**Step 4**

Download and run the certificate. The certificate is now added to your Keychain, paired with a private key:

### Creating a key .p12 file

![create-key ](img/createkey.png)

- Right-click on your new push certificate and choose **Export**.

![create-key2 ](img/createkey2.png)

- Save the certificate as pushNotification.p12 as a .p12 file.

- You will be prompted to enter a password for the p12. You can either leave this blank or enter a password of your choosing.

### Creating a push notification certificate. (der format .crt file)

- In the iOS member area, go to your app area.

![createpush](img/createpush.png)

- Under Push Notification service SSL Certificates, select **Create Certificate** (Developer or Production).

![uploadcsrfile](img/uploadcsrfile.png)

- Choose the .csr file that you created in the previous stage.

![downloadinstall](img/downloadinstall.png)

- Download the file. This file will be used to create the .pem format certificate.

### Creating both key.pem file and cert.pem file

*Note: This is used when configuring LiveEngage Push Notification.*

- Open the terminal and locate the folder in which you would like to save the file.

- Create cert pem:
**openssl x509 -in aps_development.cer -inform der -out cert.pem**

- Convert the private keys .p12 file into a .pem file:
**openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out keyWithPassword.pem -in key.p12**
You will be prompted to enter a passphrase for this file. Enter any password and remember it for the next step.

- RSA .pem key (no password)
	**openssl rsa -in hostkey.pem -out hostkey.pem**

	You will be prompted to enter a passphrase. Enter the same passphrase you used in the previous step.
