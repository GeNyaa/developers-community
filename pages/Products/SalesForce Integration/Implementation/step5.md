Now that we can create records from LiveEngage, you may view all your Chat Transcripts from Salesforce as well, as well as create reports for them.

### Looking at your Chat Transcripts

1. Login to Salesforce – click on the application menu in the top right of your screen.

2. Make sure you have the “LiveEngage” application selected (or any other app in which you’ve included the tab).

3. Click on the “Chat Transcripts” tab.

4. Select one of the recently synced chat transcripts by clicking on the “Chat Transcript Name” under the Recent ChatTranscript list.

5. There you have it – depending on your chat transcript settings, you will see a number of fields populated.

### Reporting on your Chat Transcripts

1. Login to Salesforce.

2. Choose the Reports Tab and add a new report.

3. Choose the Chat Transcript report type (if you don’t see it, use Salesforce Admin Settings to create one).

4. Customize your report to fit your needs.

5. If you are missing fields or want to include more fields from the related objects within your report, you can create your own Report Type in Salesforce and include all the fields you want/need.
