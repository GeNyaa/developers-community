Once you have identified the goals and audience of your dashboard and determined what data points to utilize, you’re ready to move forward with your designs. 

**Design your UI** 

The UX and UI of  your dashboard should be outlined and designed and should fully match to the source where the dashboard will appear with your branding in considerations 


**Design your Service**
Additional considerations to take into mind when creating your data service include:

* How often you’d like to pull the data? (all data is updated in real time)

* What intervals do you want to see the data aggregated in? (5 min slots, hours, etc)

* How do you plan to store the data? Display only? Use database or flat files as  a persistent layer? 

* Error handling: how will your service react in case of an error? What will be your retry mechanism?
