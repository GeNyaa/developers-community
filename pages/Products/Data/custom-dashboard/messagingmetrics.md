In order to create dashboard based on messaging data (in-app messaging, web messaging, facebook or sms), there are three APIs available to you.

### Messaging Operational API

As handling messaging conversations may differ from live chats, LiveEngage offers distinct APIs representing the data that is applicable to the unique operations of messaging.  Connection centers that are using messaging need to continuously evaluate their operational impact and manager dashboards in this cause must reflect the messaging queues and monitor the pace that is set to close conversations. Top metrics to utilize from the [Messaging Operations API](data-messaging-operations-overview.html){:target="_blank"} include:

* Messaging conversations: 

	* Number of conversations closed in the past 24 hours.

	* Closed  by consumer or agent? 

	* Total and average Handling time - how long it took to resolve conversations

* Messaging CSAT distribution:

	* View by agent and by skill the number of times a score was attributed in the CSAT questionnaire.  

### Messaging Agent Metrics API 

The metrics in the Messaging Agent Metrics API are recommended for the manager dashboard.  These allow managers to monitor agent performance in real time and ensure the load distribution of work is even and efficient at any given time. 

Top metrics to use:

* Agent status

* Number of open conversations

* Load on agent

### Real time Operational API

Metrics in this section will cover the information that agement managers need in order to view and monitor the activities conducted by agents throughout the shift.  In your dashboard, you can drill down per agent and display their individual breaks, loads and activities.
