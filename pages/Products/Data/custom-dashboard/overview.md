**Plan your dashboard audience & goal**

In order to be successful and save time, before you begin to pull data, consider what is the overall goal and audience for your dashboard? Common dashboards include:

* _Executive management dashboard_: high level operational overview allowing for monitoring and alerts of any unusual activity. Enables management to monitor impact on contact center following a new program or product introduction. 

_Manager dashboard_: shift management tool that combines chat/messaging and phone operations allowing managers to see activity across the board for the agents they manage.

_Agent dashboard_: Enable agents to see queue status and wait time for overall contact center and adjust their personal activity accordingly.
