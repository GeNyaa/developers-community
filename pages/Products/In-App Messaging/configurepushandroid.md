Set up your app key to enable push notifications

To do this, select from one of the following two approaches:

Approach 1: [Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/)

Approach 2: [Firebase (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client) - the new version of GCM. It inherits the reliable and scalable GCM infrastructure, plus new features.
